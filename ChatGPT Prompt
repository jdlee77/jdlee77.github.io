I need to create an html dashboard with 6 sets of 4 images. I need to be able to click on an image and it cycles through to the next image and then restarts from the original image.

Creating an HTML dashboard with the functionality you described involves a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll outline the approach and provide you with a basic implementation.

Step 1: HTML Structure
You'll create a dashboard with 6 sets of 4 images each. Each set will be contained in its own div element for organization and styling purposes.

Step 2: CSS Styling
Use CSS for basic styling of your dashboard and image sets. You can adjust this according to your design preferences.

Step 3: JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript will handle the cycling of images within each set. When an image is clicked, it will change to the next image in the set. After the last image, it will cycle back to the first image.

Here's a simplified version of what your code might look like:

HTML
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Image Dashboard</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="image-set" id="set1">
        <img src="image1-1.jpg" alt="" onclick="cycleImage(this, 'set1')">
        <img src="image1-2.jpg" alt="" onclick="cycleImage(this, 'set1')" style="display:none;">
        <img src="image1-3.jpg" alt="" onclick="cycleImage(this, 'set1')" style="display:none;">
        <img src="image1-4.jpg" alt="" onclick="cycleImage(this, 'set1')" style="display:none;">
    </div>
    <!-- Repeat for sets 2 through 6 -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
CSS (style.css)
css
Copy code
.image-set {
    margin: 20px;
}

.image-set img {
    width: 100px; /* Adjust as needed */
    height: 100px; /* Adjust as needed */
    cursor: pointer;
}
JavaScript (script.js)
javascript
Copy code
function cycleImage(currentImage, setId) {
    const set = document.getElementById(setId);
    const images = set.getElementsByTagName('img');
    let found = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < images.length; i++) {
        if (found) {
            images[i].style.display = 'block';
            break;
        }
        if (images[i] === currentImage) {
            images[i].style.display = 'none';
            found = true;
        }
    }
    if (!found || images[images.length - 1] === currentImage) {
        images[0].style.display = 'block';
    }
}
Explanation:
HTML: Each image set is contained within a div with a unique id. Each image has an onclick event that calls cycleImage, passing this (the clicked image) and the id of the set it belongs to.
CSS: Provides basic styling. You can adjust the sizes, margins, etc., as needed.
JavaScript: The cycleImage function hides the current image and shows the next one in the set. If the current image is the last in the set, it shows the first image again.
This is a basic implementation. Depending on your exact requirements (like if the images are dynamically generated or if you have more complex styling needs), you might need to adjust or expand upon this code.
